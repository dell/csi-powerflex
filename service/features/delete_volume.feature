Feature: VxFlex OS CSI interface
  As a consumer of the CSI interface
  I want to test delete service methods
  So that they are known to work

  Scenario: Delete volume with valid CapacityRange capabilities BlockVolume, SINGLE_NODE_WRITER and null VolumeContentSource.
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a valid volume
    When I call Probe
    And I call DeleteVolume with "single-writer"
    Then a valid DeleteVolumeResponse is returned

  Scenario: Delete volume with valid CapacityRange capabilities BlockVolume,  MULTI_NODE_READER_ONLY null VolumeContentSource.
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a valid volume
    When I call Probe
    And I call DeleteVolume with "multiple-reader"
    Then a valid DeleteVolumeResponse is returned

  Scenario: Delete volume with valid CapacityRange capabilities BlockVolume, MULTI_NODE_WRITE null VolumeContentSource.
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a valid volume
    When I call Probe
    And I call DeleteVolume with "multiple-writer"
    Then a valid DeleteVolumeResponse is returned

  Scenario: Test idempotent deletion volume valid CapacityRange capabilities BlockVolume, SINGLE_NODE_WRITER and null VolumeContentSource (2nd attempt to delete same volume should be nop.)
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a valid volume
    When I call Probe
    And I call DeleteVolume with "single-writer"
    And I call DeleteVolume with "single-writer"
    Then a valid DeleteVolumeResponse is returned

  Scenario: Delete volume with induced getVolByID error
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a valid volume
    And I induce error "GetVolByIDError"
    When I call Probe
    And I call DeleteVolume with "single-writer"
    Then the error contains "induced error"

  Scenario: Delete a volume with induced SIOGatewayVolumeNotFound error
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a valid volume
    And I induce error "SIOGatewayVolumeNotFound"
    When I call Probe
    And I call DeleteVolume with "single-writer"
    Then a valid DeleteVolumeResponse is returned

  Scenario: Delete volume with an invalid volume
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And an invalid volume
    When I call Probe
    And I call DeleteVolume with "single-writer"
    Then the error contains "volume not found"

  Scenario: Delete volume with an invalid volume id
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a valid volume
    And I induce error "BadVolIDError"
    When I call Probe
    And I call DeleteVolume with "single-writer"
    Then a valid DeleteVolumeResponse is returned

  Scenario: Delete Volume with invalid probe cache
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a valid volume
    When I invalidate the Probe cache
    And I call DeleteVolume with "single-writer"
    Then the error contains "Controller Service has not been probed"
