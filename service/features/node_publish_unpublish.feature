Feature: VxFlex OS CSI interface
  As a consumer of the CSI interface
  I want to test list service methods
  So that they are known to work

  Scenario Outline: Node publish various use cases from examples
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a controller published volume
    And a capability with voltype <voltype> access <access> fstype <fstype>
    When I call Probe
    When I call NodePublishVolume "SDC_GUID"
    Then the error contains <errormsg>

    Examples:
      | voltype | access                      | fstype | errormsg                                                          |

    Then the error contains "systemID is not found in the request and there is no default system"

  Scenario: Get device given invalid path
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    When I call GetDevice "INVALIDPATH"
    Then the error contains "invalid path error"

  Scenario Outline: Call getMappedVols with correct and incorrect inputs
    Given two identical volumes on two different systems
    When I call getMappedVols with volID <volID> and sysID <sysID>
    Then the error contains <errormsg>

    Examples:
      | volID              | sysID              | errormsg                                                                     |
      | "c0f055aa00000000" | "34dbbf5617523654" | "none"                                                                       |
      | "c0f055aa00000000" | "14dbbf5617523654" | "volume: c0f055aa00000000 on system: 14dbbf5617523654 not published to node" |

  Scenario: Check that getMappedVols returns correct volume from correct system
    Given two identical volumes on two different systems
    When I call getMappedVols with volID "c0f055aa00000000" and sysID "34dbbf5617523654"
    Then the volume "c0f055aa00000000" is from the correct system "34dbbf5617523654"

  Scenario: Call CleanupPrivateTarget to verify that when target mounts exist, private target is not deleted
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a controller published volume
    And a capability with voltype "mount" access "single-reader" fstype "none"
    And get Node Publish Volume Request
    When I call Probe
    And I call NodePublishVolume "SDC_GUID"
    And I call CleanupPrivateTarget
    Then the error contains "Cannot delete private mount as target mount exist"

  Scenario: Call removeWithRetry negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call removeWithRetry
    Then the error contains "read-only file system"

  Scenario: Call I call unmountPrivMount negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call unmountPrivMount
    Then the error contains "error in unmountPrivMount"

  Scenario: Call I call getPathMounts negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call getPathMounts
    Then the error contains "error in GetPathMounts"

  Scenario: Call handlePrivFSMount  negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call handlePrivFSMount
    Then the error contains "error in handlePrivFSMount"

  Scenario: Call evalSymlinks negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call evalSymlinks
    Then the error contains "error in evalSymlinks"

  Scenario: Call evalSymlinks negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call CleanupPrivateTarget for errors
    Then the error contains "error in CleanupPrivateTarget"

  Scenario: mount publishVolume negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call mount publishVolume
    Then the error contains "error in publishVolume"

  Scenario: Call unpublishVolume negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call mount unpublishVolume
    Then the error contains "error in unpublishVolume"

  Scenario: Call mount validateVolCapabilities negative test
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And I call mountValidateBlockVolCapabilities
    Then the error contains "Unknown Access Mode"

# Scenario: Call block validateVolCapabilities negative test
#   Given a VxFlexOS service
#   And I call blockValidateBlockVolCapabilities
#   Then the error contains "Unknown Access Mode"

  Scenario: Check if the CleanupPrivateTarget target deletes private target when there are no target mounts.
    Given a VxFlexOS service
    And a controller published volume
    And a capability with voltype "mount" access "single-reader" fstype "none"
    And get Node Publish Volume Request
    When I call Probe
    And I call NodePublishVolume "SDC_GUID"
    And I call UnmountAndDeleteTarget
    And I call CleanupPrivateTarget
    Then the error contains "none"
    And I call NodeUnpublishVolume "SDC_GUID"
    Then the error contains "none"
