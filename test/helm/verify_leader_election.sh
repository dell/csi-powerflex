# To run this test, you must:
#     Not have any other tests currently running on cluster(This test will bring down and revive worker nodes)
#     Have driver installed with more than 1 controller pod
# This test will perform the following in order:
#     Ensure that the pod with lease is accepting requests, while pod without lease isn't
#	  Kill driver container on pod with lease and check that a leader election is triggered
#     Ssh into the lease holder pod's node and reboot it, triggering a  leader election
#	  Ssh into the lease holder pod's node and bring down the network interface (specified by -i flag),  forcing a lease transfer

	echo '''This script tests controller-HA support and leader election for a driver
        Arguments:
        --namespace namespace driver is deployed in, for example: --namespace vxflexos
        --interface network interface to bring down during network fail test, for example: --interface ens192
        --time-down time to keep network interface down for during network fail test, in seconds. For example: --time-down 60
        --user user usually either "root" or "core". For example: --user root
        --skip-docker set this flag if docker is not the container engine being used. Docker tests need to be skipped for now
	--safe-mode set this flag to skip reboot step 

        for upstream k8s:
        ./verify_leader_election.sh --namespace vxflexos --interface ens192 --time-down 120 --user root
        will test the vxflexos driver leader election, and for the network fail test, interface ens192, while using root user

        for openshift:
         ./verify_leader_election.sh --namespace test-vxflexos --interface ens192 --time-down 120 --user core --skip-docker
        will test the driver leader election using core user, and will skip the docker tests since podman is specified
        will be brought down for 60 seconds
