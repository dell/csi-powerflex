  And a basic block volume request "integration3" "8"
  And I call CreateVolume
  When I call CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot
  And remove a volume from VolumeGroupSnapshotRequest 
  When I call CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot
  And I call DeleteVGS
  And when I call DeleteAllVolumes
  Then the error message should contain "contains more snapshots"
