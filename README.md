**Repository for CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerFlex**

## Description
CSI Driver for PowerFlex is a Container Storage Interface ([CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec)) driver that provides support for provisioning persistent storage using Dell EMC PowerFlex storage array.

It supports CSI specification version 1.2.

This project may be compiled as a stand-alone binary using Golang that, when run, provides a valid CSI endpoint. It also can be used as a precompiled container image.

For Documentation, please go to [Dell CSI Driver Documentation](https://dell.github.io/storage-plugin-docs/).

## Support
The CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerFlex image, which is the built driver code, is available on Dockerhub and is officially supported by Dell EMC.  

The source code for CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerFlex available on Github is unsupported and provided solely under the terms of the license attached to the source code. 

For clarity, Dell EMC does not provide support for any source code modifications.  

For any CSI driver issues, questions or feedback, join the [Dell EMC Container community](https://www.dell.com/community/Containers/bd-p/Containers).

## Building
This project is a Go module (see golang.org Module information for explanation).
The dependencies for this project are in the go.mod file.

To build the source, execute `make clean build`.

To run unit tests, execute `make unit-test`.

To build an image, execute `make docker`.

You can run an integration test on a Linux system by populating the file `env.sh`
with values for your PowerFlex system and then run "make integration-test".

## Runtime Dependencies
The Node portion of the driver can only be run on nodes which have network connectivity to a “`PowerFlex Cluster`” via PowerFlex SDC Client (which is used by the driver). This means that the `scini` kernel module must be loaded. 

Also, if the `X_CSI_VXFLEXOS_SDCGUID` environment variable is not set, the driver will attempt to query the SDC GUID automatically. If this fails, the driver will not run.

## Driver Installation
Please consult the [Installation Guide](https://dell.github.io/storage-plugin-docs/docs/installation/)

As referenced in the guide, installation in a Kubernetes cluster should be done using the scripts within the `dell-csi-helm-installer` directory. For more detailed information on the scripts, consult the [README.md](dell-csi-helm-installer/README.md)

## Using driver
A number of test helm charts and scripts are found in the directory test/helm. Please refer to the section `Testing Drivers` in the [Documentation](https://dell.github.io/storage-plugin-docs/docs/installation/test/) for more info.
