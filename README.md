**Repository for CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerFlex**

## Description
CSI Driver for PowerFlex is part of the [CSM (Container Storage Modules)](https://github.com/dell/csm) open-source suite of Kubernetes storage enablers for Dell EMC products. CSI Driver for PowerFlex is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that provides support for provisioning persistent storage using Dell EMC PowerFlex storage array. 

It supports CSI specification version 1.5.

This project may be compiled as a stand-alone binary using Golang that, when run, provides a valid CSI endpoint. It also can be used as a precompiled container image.

## Support
For any CSI driver issues, questions or feedback, please follow our [support process](https://github.com/dell/csm/blob/main/docs/SUPPORT.md)

## Building
This project is a Go module (see golang.org Module information for explanation).
The dependencies for this project are in the go.mod file.

To build the source, execute `make clean build`.

To run unit tests, execute `make unit-test`.

To build an image, execute `make docker`.

You can run an integration test on a Linux system by populating the file `env.sh`
with values for your PowerFlex system and then run "make integration-test".

## Runtime Dependencies
The Node portion of the driver can only be run on nodes which have network connectivity to a “`PowerFlex Cluster`” via PowerFlex SDC Client (which is used by the driver). This means that the `scini` kernel module must be loaded. 

Also, if the `X_CSI_VXFLEXOS_SDCGUID` environment variable is not set, the driver will attempt to query the SDC GUID automatically. If this fails, the driver will not run.

## Driver Installation
